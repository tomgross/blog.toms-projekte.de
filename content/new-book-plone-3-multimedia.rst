I was tired of reading and answering all the p4a related questions on
the Plone user mailing list and wrote a book about it ;-).

The `book`_ is now available:

In the book you will find help on how to set up a customized multimedia
CMS by collaborating with external resources such as YouTube, Google
videos as well as to use and extend specialized multimedia content-types
for images, audio, video, and Flash.

Plone 3 Multimedia provides a rich repository of tools and techniques to
add full multimedia power to Plone along with collaboration with many
external web resources in order to build an interactive Plone site. The
readers will learn to structure their content by tagging, rating, and
geolocating through this practical guide. Furthermore, it also gives
readers an insight into how to upload, store, and serve their multimedia
content in an effective way.

Using this book, developers will be able to include photos, movies,
audio, and Flash-applications into their Plone site to make it more
user-friendly. In addition to learning about the various video and audio
formats best suited for web publishing, developers will also be able to
get to grips with categorization, syndication, upload, storage, and
serving of multimedia content. This book will also enable developers to
create an engaging user experience by including powerful Silverlight web
and mobile applications into Plone.

A step-by-step tutorial packed with hands-on-examples, this book is
ideal for Plone integrators who want to extend the core of Plone with
multimedia features and want to learn to use multimedia effectively. The
book is out now and available from Packt. To read more about it, please
